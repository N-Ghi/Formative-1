# Inventory Management System
> A comprehensive full-stack web application for efficient inventory tracking, stock management, and automated low-stock alerts

## African Context

In many African markets, small to medium-sized businesses face significant challenges in managing their inventory effectively. Traditional paper-based systems are prone to errors, making it difficult to track stock levels, identify low-stock items, and make informed purchasing decisions. This often leads to stockouts of popular items or overstocking of slow-moving products, both of which negatively impact business profitability.

Our Inventory Management System addresses these challenges by providing an accessible, user-friendly digital solution that helps African entrepreneurs and business owners modernize their operations. By automating inventory management with real-time alerts and comprehensive search capabilities, business owners can focus on growth and customer service rather than manual record-keeping, ultimately contributing to the digital transformation of African commerce.

## Project Overview

The Inventory Management System is a modern full-stack web application designed to streamline inventory operations for businesses of all sizes. Built with React on the frontend and Express.js on the backend, the application provides real-time visibility into stock levels, automated alerts for low inventory, and powerful search and filtering capabilities.

The system enables business owners to maintain accurate records of their products, track stock movements, set restock thresholds, and receive proactive notifications when items fall below specified levels. With comprehensive authentication and authorization, multiple users can securely access and manage inventory data. The application's dashboard provides at-a-glance statistics and insights, helping managers make informed decisions about purchasing and stock allocation.

With an intuitive user interface, robust backend architecture using Sequelize ORM, and JWT-based security, the platform scales to accommodate growing businesses while remaining simple enough for users with minimal technical expertise. The responsive design ensures seamless operation across desktop, tablet, and mobile devices, making it ideal for busy entrepreneurs who need to manage their inventory on the go.
